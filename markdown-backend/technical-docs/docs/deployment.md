# Deployment

Deploying the `markdown-backend` allows it to be accessible over the internet or within a network. Below are guidelines for deploying the application.

## Deployment Options

1. **Cloud Providers**:
   - You can deploy the backend on cloud platforms such as:
     - **Heroku**: A platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
     - **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: Offers a wide range of cloud computing services, including EC2 for hosting applications.
     - **DigitalOcean**: Provides cloud services that help to deploy and scale applications.

2. **Containerization**:
   - Use Docker to containerize the application, making it easy to deploy across different environments.
   - Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of your project:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM node:14
     WORKDIR /usr/src/app
     COPY package*.json ./
     RUN npm install
     COPY . .
     EXPOSE 3000
     CMD ["node", "server.js"]
     ```
   - Build and run the Docker container:
     ```bash
     docker build -t markdown-backend .
     docker run -p 3000:3000 markdown-backend
     ```

3. **Local Server**:
   - For local deployment, ensure that the server is running on a machine that is accessible to your network.
   - Use the following command to start the server:
     ```bash
     node server.js
     ```

## Best Practices

- **Environment Variables**: Ensure that sensitive information, such as API keys and database credentials, are stored in environment variables and not hard-coded in the application.
- **Logging**: Implement logging to monitor the applicationâ€™s performance and errors.
- **Security**: Use HTTPS to secure your API endpoints and protect data in transit.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Regularly monitor the application for performance issues and errors.
- Keep dependencies up to date to avoid security vulnerabilities.
